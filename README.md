Cordova Camera Roll
==========================

The Cordova Camera Roll plugin makes it easy to read from the iOS camera roll.

Cordova comes with some camera features such as `navigator.camera.getPicture`. The problem is you have no
control over the experience beyond that. On iOS, for example, a modal slides in that lets you choose a picture.

With this plugin you can get a list of all photos and do whatever you want with them after that.

This plugin only works with iOS and was only tested on iOS 7. We will not support other platforms
with this plugin for a variety of reasons (possibly Android in the future though).
